      <h1>About me and what I do</h1>
      <p>Hey, I am Liana. I specialise in creating designs for websites.
        <br><br>
        Starting back in 2017, my journey has been full of constant education and work.

        I've been doing a lot of self-learning and that has really sharpened my research skills. However, I also have a
        web design certificate and web development diploma.
        <br><br>
        I used to create designs and websites for people, but that was just a side job. In mid 2022, I finally started
        working on this business full time - viola, it's been only a few months and this website is finally live! =)
        <br><br>
        So yeah, I know web design and development,
        graphic design, and marketing.
        <br><br>
        Having the power of these I am able to create design that is not only simple
        to use and looks great but effectively delivers the message and turns prospects into clients.</p>

  <div class="container" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
    <p>My job isn’t just about making an aesthetically appealing and intuituve design - that stuff I do by default
      (and
      I do it good).
      <br><br>
      What I’m really focusing on is understanding you, your business and your goals.
      <br><br>

      Your values. Your client.
      <br><br>

      Why you do what you do and why others should care.
      <br><br>

      All this is to articulate your value proposition to make the design immensly powerful.</p>

        <h1>Alright, enough about me.</h1>
        <h1 style="color: #FF3C3C; margin-top: 3rem;">Because, really, it’s all about <u>you</u>.</h1>

  <section id="looks">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>I get it, your looks are indeed important.</h1>
      <p>Aesthetics and comfort matter.
        In design, we call it good visuals, user interface and experience.
        <br><br>
        <span class="highlight">I deliver you these features through custom design and unique approach to the
          project.</span>
      </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="div"></div>

    <div class="p-cont">
      <div class="p-bg"></div>
      <p class="p">All of the above are vital for any business. Your customer's journey
        starts from the
        very
        first interaction they have with your brand, whether it's through your website, app, or brick-and-mortar
        store.
        <br><br>
        It's important to make a good first impression, as this will set the tone for the rest of their customer
        journey.
        If you can provide a smooth and seamless customer experience from start to finish, you'll be well on your way
        to
        acquiring and retaining loyal customers.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, a positive user experience will also lead to
        increased conversions and sales.
        <br><br>
        Investing in an aesthetically pleasing and simple interface and user experience is one way to set yourself
        apart
        and give yourself a competitive advantage.
        <br><br>
        It’s also important to have your brand identity communicated through the design, because you obviously don’t
        want
        to blend in with others, right?</p>

  <section id="right-thing">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>We want your visitors to do the “right” thing.</h1>
      <p>In order for this to happen, I have a strategy in place.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="div"></div>

    <div class="p-cont">
      <div class="p-bg"></div>
      <p class="p">You and I will have put a lot of time and effort into your website.
        <br><br>

        You’d want visitors to stay awhile, browse around, and ultimately become clients.
        <br><br>
        It works through smart visual hierarchy of elements on your website, which include text, images and graphics.
        <br><br>

        With a thought-through design that I offer, visitors will perceive information quicker and easier, and be guided
        to become clients. This way you're giving your visitors the best possible chance to engage with your site and
        convert into clients.</p>

  <section id="care">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>I <strike>take</strike> give care for your funds.</h1>
      <p><span class="highlight">I carefully determine all your needs and have a strategy in place to make sure
          your design
          is
          complete.</span> This
        results in a lower cost for you overall.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="div"></div>

    <div class="p-cont">
      <div class="p-bg"></div>
      <p class="p">
        Who wants any <b>unforeseen costs</b>?
        <br><br>
        Right, nobody.
        <br><br>
        A well-planned design for a website can result in <b>lower development costs</b> and <b></b>avoid additional
        costs in the
        future.
        <br><br>

        In addition, should any changes need to be made down the road, they will likely be <b>much less expensive</b>
        than if
        no good planning had been done upfront.
        <br><br>

        So not only can you <b>save money</b> by having a <b>well-planned design</b>, but you can also avoid costly
        surprises
        down the
        road.

  <section id="quick">
    <div class="container">
      <h1>We all want it quick & simple.</h1>
      <p>I strive to create more intuitive websites that result in bigger sales and happier customers for your business.
        It's the right thing to do.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="div"></div>

    <div class="p-cont">
      <div class="p-bg"></div>
      <p class="p">After all, who wants to waste their time searching for something on a website with bad design?
        <br><br>

        You want your visitors to be able to find what they're looking for quickly and easily, so they can be satisfied
        faster and move on with their lives.
        <br><br>

        And of course, the faster they're satisfied, the bigger your sales will be.
        <br><br>

        Plus, you'll build customer loyalty because they'll be so impressed with how intuitive and good looking your
        website is.
        <br><br>

        So really, it's a win-win for everyone involved. </p>
